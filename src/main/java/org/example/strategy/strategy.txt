Implementation details :

FileType is the abstract class, which would be extended by different types of files for example PDFInvoiceFile and ExcelQuotationFile

Different behaviours are used as FileContentDecider(interface) and FileTypeDecider(interface) which are used as composition(has-a) in FileType abstract class

InvoiceFile, QuotationFile implements FileContentDecider(interface)
PDFFileType, TextFileType, ExcelFileType implements FileTypeDecider(interface)

We then create classes with different configurations from the available file types and content and then create classes
, we then use those classes in our client application (ex: PDFInvoiceFile, ExcelQuotationFile).
